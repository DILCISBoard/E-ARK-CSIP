COMMON SPECIFICATION FOR INFORMATION PACKAGES
=============================================
This is the web site for the E-ARK Common Specification for Information
Packages. The site is still a work in progress as we restructure the
specification. The site current site contents are as follows.

E-ARK CSIP
---------
An HTML version of the E-ARK Common Specification for Information Packages the
[table of Contents](./specification/) is a good place to start.
It's possible to refer to the main sections of the specification by URL,
e.g. "PART II: Implementation of the CS IP" is located at
https://carlwilson.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/.
Lower level headings have page anchors, e.g. 5.3 Use of METS has the URL
https://carlwilson.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/metadata/#53-use-of-mets.
Individual requirements also have page anchors and URLS, e.g.
https://carlwilson.github.io/E-ARK-CSIP/specification/implementation/metadata/#CSIP80.

Note that this site version is published from a
