### 	Use of the METS root element (element mets)
The METS document's root element (`<mets>`) describes the container for the information being stored and/or transmitted. The `<mets>` element of a CSIP conformant METS document uses attributes from the METS specification and additional attributes defined in the CSIP extension schema.

As well as the METS and CSIP extension attributes, the METS document's root `<mets>` element must define all of the relevant namespaces and locations for XML schema used in the package. This is done using the `@xmlns` and `@xsi:schemaLocation` attributes as described in ["Referencing a Schema in an XML Document"](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_schema.asp). The schema identifiers and locations for a typical CSIP `<mets>` element are shown below:

```xml
  <mets:mets xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xmlns:mets="http://www.loc.gov/METS/"
    xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
    xmlns:csip="https://DILCIS.eu/XML/METS/CSIPExtensionMETS"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.loc.gov/METS/ http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/mets.xsd
                       http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/xlink.xsd
                       https://DILCIS.eu/XML/METS/CSIPExtensionMETS https://earkcsip.dilcis.eu/schema/DILCISExtensionMETS.xsd">
```
#### Location of XML schema
When using XML schemas the availability of the actual schema resources should be considered. Externally hosted resources are not guaranteed to be available in the future, or in restricted operating environments. We recommend that copies of all XML schema resources should be included in the information package, located in appropriate 'schemas' folders at package or representation level. When schemas have been included in the package `schemas` folder, links to the schema documents should refer to the relative path of the schema file within the package, i.e. `schemas/mets.xsd`.

The specific requirements for the root element and its attributes are described in the following table.
