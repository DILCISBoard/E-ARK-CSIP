### Use of the METS descriptive metadata section (element dmdSec)

The purpose of the METS descriptive metadata section is to embed or refer to files containing descriptive metadata. CSIP is only using referencing of files containing descriptive metadata.

The CSIP does not prescribe or assume the use of specific descriptive metadata schemas. This means implementers are free to use descriptive metadata  standards of their choosing inside a CSIP package.

Specific elements for which the exact use is fixed within this specification are highlighted in the following table.
