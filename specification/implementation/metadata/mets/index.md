## 5.3 Use of METS
The main requirement for METS files in a CS IP Information Package is that these need to follow the official METS Schema version 1.11 . As new versions of METS Schema become available the DILCIS Board will evaluate these and, if necessary, update the CS IP respectively.

The following text assumes knowledge of the principles of the METS specifications. If this is not the case, please consult the official documentation  before continuing.

The rest of this Section is structured according to the core METS elements: METS root element `mets`, `header`, `amdSec`, `dmdSec`, `fileSec`, `structMap`, and `behaviourSec`. In each of these sections we explain in a
concise way limitations imposed by the CS IP implementation when compared to the official METS documentation. Also, differences between creating a root METS file and representation METS file are described when relevant.

All names of elements and attributes below are expressed using the XLink notation (i.e. `element/sub-element/@attribute`)
