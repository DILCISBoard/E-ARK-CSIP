## Folder structure of the CSIP
The CSIP folder structure is presented in [Figure 8](#fig8) below. The structure directly follows the principles of the conceptual data model, dividing the package components into individual folders for representations, metadata, and other components. All of folders described **ought to** be present even if they are empty.
